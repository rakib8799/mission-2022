                                                Coding, sometimes called
                                                computer programming, is how we
                                                communicate with computers. Code
                                                tells a computer what actions to
                                                take, and writing code is like
                                                creating a set of instructions.
                                                By learning to write code, you
                                                can tell computers what to do or
                                                how to behave in a much faster
                                                way. You can use this skill to
                                                make websites and apps, process
                                                data, and do lots of other cool
